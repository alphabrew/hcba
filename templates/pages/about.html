    <p><em>About HCBA</em></p>

    <h1>We are the Howard County Beekeepers Association</h1>

    <p>Welcome to the Howard County Beekeepers Association website! â€‹

We are an all-volunteer non-profit association whose mission is to promote beekeeping in Howard County Maryland by providing a forum in which current beekeepers may become more knowledgeable of best practices and share experiences in the keeping and management of honeybee colonies. </p>

<p>We strive to educate the public on the benefits of honey bees and other pollinators by attending local community events and conducting a fall seminar and an early spring beginning beekeeping courses.  We also have affiliations, such as the Howard County Conservancy and Robinson Nature Center, to promote beekeeping and to educate the public.</p>

<p>We hope you enjoy exploring our site and look forward to meeting you at one of our meetings or outreach events.</p>
